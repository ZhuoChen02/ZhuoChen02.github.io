Hi, I am a first year Ph.D. student at Data Intelligence Group (DIG), School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), supervised by Prof. Wen Li and Prof. Lixin Duan. Prior to that, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in the SCSE at UESTC. My research interests focus on deep generative models for visual content creation.
